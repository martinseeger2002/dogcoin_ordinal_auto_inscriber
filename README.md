    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return len(data.get("txrefs", [])) > 0

#### Function to wait for UTXO completion before proceeding
def wait_for_utxo_completion(wallet_address):
    while not check_utxos(wallet_address):
        print("Waiting for UTXOs to complete...")
