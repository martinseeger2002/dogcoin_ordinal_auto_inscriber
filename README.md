# Auto_inscriber_OG.py : üíØ 

Big Chiefs Version of Auto inscriber (auto_inscriber_OG.py) 


# Auto_inscriber_OG2.py : üëçüèª 
Auto Minter Version Changed 60 Second Sleep to 300 seconds Because of mempool congestion.....change parameters to your needs. 60 seconds Cooks FAST.....When mempools not busy


# Auto_inscriber_v3.py : üî¢ 

An untested work in Progress Auto inscriber Version of Big Chiefs OG script free to play with i would also like to still add @BookOnDoge's  utxo tracker script idea as well Auto inscriber Version im working on for auto mempool tracking, auto fee set in .env file based on mempool congestion, max retry limit with breaktime parameters as well. This modification adds a functionality to adjust fees in the .env file based on mempool congestion, and adds a wallet sync command after adjusting fees and waits for 60 seconds before proceeding with the next commands. Make sure to place it in the appropriate location within your script.

# Auto_inscriber_v4.py

This version (v4) of the Python script enhances the inscription automation process for a collection of digital images using Node.js commands. Specifically, it addresses and resolves errors related to 25KB file-sized inscriptions. The script interacts with a blockchain-based system, performing minting and wallet synchronization for each image within a specified range.

# Auto_inscriber_v5.py

The script now robustly captures and logs txids in both scenarios - a direct success from the mint command and a success from the wallet sync command after encountering the 'too-long-mempool-chain' error. This ensures that no successful transactions go unlogged, maintaining accurate records in your JSON file.

# createHtmlCollection.py

This script generates HTML files with specific titles and structure. The file titles are "Collection Name #x", where x ranges from the start to end values provided. In your example, it's creating files named from "Collection00001.html" to "Collection10000.html".

Each HTML file follows a set template, including basic HTML structure with a head and body section. The title of each page is dynamically set to match its filename. The script also includes references to two JavaScript files located at /content/, but the actual script IDs ("<js lib inscription ID>" and "<content script inscription ID>") are placeholders and would need to be replaced with actual IDs.

To personalize the script for your specific collection, you would replace the placeholder "Collection Name" in the template string with the name of your collection. This placeholder currently appears in the <title> tag within the HTML template. When the script runs, it uses this template to create each HTML file, so changing the placeholder will reflect in the title of every generated HTML file.

### Wish List to add:

@Books part of script i want to add to  Version OG 2 : üî¢ 

UTXO Tracker to V3 auto inscriber at the very top of script:

import requests
import time

#### Function to check for UTXOs at a specified Dogecoin address using the BlockCypher API
def check_utxos(address):
    url = f"https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/doge/main/addrs/{address}?unspentOnly=true"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return len(data.get("txrefs", [])) > 0

#### Function to wait for UTXO completion before proceeding
def wait_for_utxo_completion(wallet_address):
    while not check_utxos(wallet_address):
        print("Waiting for UTXOs to complete...")
        time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
